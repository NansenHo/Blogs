# HTTP & HTTPS

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, a protocol for transferring data which is understood by browser and server.

HTTPS: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure: HTTP + Data encryption (during transmission)

HTTPS is the same with SSL encryption turned on where all the data that is transmitted is actually encrypted.
