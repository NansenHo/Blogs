# What's a design pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.

The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

## Criticism of patterns

- Inefficient solutions

Patterns try to systematize approaches that are already widely used. This unification is viewed by many as a dogma, and they implement patterns "to the letter", without adapting them to the context of their project.

- unjustified use

## Classification of patterns

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called `idioms`.
They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are `architectural patterns`.
Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language.
Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.

Three main groups of patterns:

1. Creational Design Patterns

   provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. Structural Design Patterns

   explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral Design Patterns

   take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
