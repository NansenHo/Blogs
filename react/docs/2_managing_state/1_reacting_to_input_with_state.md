# Reacting to Input With State

When developing a component: 

1. Identify all its visual states.

2. Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes.

3. Model the state with `useState`.

4. Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.

5. Connect the event handlers to set state.
