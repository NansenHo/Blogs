## What's TypeScript

TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.

TypeScript and C# both were created by the same person named Anders Hejlsberg

## Terminologies

Loosely/Weekly Typed Language do not require type specification
For examples: JavaScript, Ruby, PHP

**A language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed**.

- TypeScript is a statically typed language.
That means types are checked at compile time.
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
That means types are checked at run time.

## Benefits of TypeScript

1. self-documenting
2. catch errors in dev
3. great for team
